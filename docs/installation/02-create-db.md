Database
--------

Security Monkey needs a postgres database. Select one of the following:

-   Local Postgres (You'll set this up later once you have an instance up.).
-   [Postgres on AWS RDS](../postgres_aws.md).
-   [Postgres on GCP's Cloud SQL](../postgres_gcp.md).
-   Currently OpenStack utilizes a local postgres database.
