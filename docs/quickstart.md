Quick Start Guide
=================

Setup on AWS, GCP, or OpenStack
-------------------------------

Security Monkey can run on an [Amazon EC2 (AWS)](iam_aws.md) instance, [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](iam_gcp.md) instance (Google Cloud Platform), or [OpenStack (public or private cloud)](iam_openstack.md) instance.
The only real difference in the installation is the IAM configuration and the bringup of the Virtual Machine that runs Security Monkey.

### Running Security Monkey in Production
The Quickstart guide is great for learning about Security Monkey and trying it, but it is not adequate for production deployments.  If you follow the steps in Quickstart Security Monkey will not automatically scan your environment and won't scale for large accounts.  For production deployment guidance please read [Autostarting](autostarting.md) and [Tuning the Watchers/Prioritizing](tuneworkers.md) before beginning installation.
