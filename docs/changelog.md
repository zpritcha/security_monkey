Changelog
=========

v1.0.0 (2018-02-19)
--------------------
Major Milestone release.

There are many, many changes that have been made.  Below are some of the most important items to keep note of:

1. **BREAKING CHANGES -- ALL NEW DEPLOYMENT MODEL** (Please review the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) and [Autostarting](autostarting.md) docs for details)
    - We swapped out APScheduler in favor of Celery. This allows us to actually scale Security Monkey with multiple UI instances, and many, many workers so
      you can get data into Security Monkey much faster!
1. Lots, and lots of bug fixes and documentation updates
1. New features:
    - OpenStack watching and auditing support
    - GitHub Organization, Repos, and Teams watching and auditing
    - AWS GovCloud Support
    - Azure AD SSO provider support
    - AWS Glacier support
    - Support for [SWAG account syncing](https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/swag-client).
    - Auditor improvements
    - Ability to import bulk network whitelists (and via S3)

1. Many IAM changes. [Please review the IAM docs](https://github.com/Netflix/security_monkey/blob/develop/docs/quickstart.md#account-types) and update your permissions accordingly.

    - Where you might once call `python manage.py <arguments>` you will now call `monkey <arguments>`
- Documentation has been converted from RST to Markdown.
    - I will no longer be using readthedocs or RST.
    - Quickstart guide has been largely re-written.
    - Quickstart now instructs you to create and use a virtualenv (and how to get supervisor to work with it)
- This release contains [GCP Watcher Support](https://medium.com/@Netflix_Techblog/netflix-security-monkey-on-google-cloud-platform-gcp-f221604c0cc7).

v0.3.6 (2015-04-09)
-------------------

-   Changes to issue score in code will now cause all existing issues to be re-scored in the database.
-   A new configuration parameter called SECURITYGROUP\_INSTANCE\_DETAIL can now be set to:  
    -   "FULL": Security Groups will display each instances, and all instance tags, that are associated with the security group.
    -   "SUMMARY": Security Groups will display the number of instances attached to the security group.
    -   "NONE": Security Groups will not retrieve any data about instances attached to a security group.
    -   If SECURITY\_GROUP\_INSTANCE\_DETAIL is set to "FULL" or "SUMMARY", empty security groups audit issues will have their score set to zero.
    -   For accounts with many thousands of instances, it is advised to set this to "NONE" as the AWS API's do not respond in a timely manner with that many instances.

-   Each watcher can be set to run at a different interval in code. We will want to move this to be a UI setting.
-   Watchers may specify a list of ephemeral paths. Security\_monkey will not send out change alerts for items in the ephemeral section. This is a good place for metadata that is often changing like the number of instances attached to a security\_group or the number of remaining IP addresses in a VPC subnet.
